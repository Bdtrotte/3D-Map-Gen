# 3D-Map-Gen

## General Goal
Simplify level design for video games.
A user will be able to draw a simple 2D tile map and have it converted into a high detail 3D mesh.

## Frameworks
We use Qt, C++ and OpenGL.

## Documentation
Many classes, methods and attributes are decorated with Doxygen comments (/** \*/ or triple slashes). Use [Doxygen](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/download.html) ([Getting Started](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/manual/starting.html)) to generate docs. All sources are in 3D-Map-Gen/WallsAndHoles/.
